# GraphQL server

---

Start with schema

^ When you want to use GraphQL, think about your data schema. It doesn't need to be a solid and super stable database design, you can start with bare minimum. Think about schema as if you were creating tables in an SQL database: just before you start querying it, you need to define columns and such. With GraphQL, it's similar, but instead of columns, you have _queries_ and _fields_.

---

### What is GraphQL schema?

^ GraphQL schema has to be _shareable_ between client and server; usually it's a massive JSON. In this JSON, all possible queries are defined, so that your front-end knows if a certain query is valid, and if so, how to decontruct it; and your back-end knows how to _resolve_ fields of the query, which basically means that, for every entity that client requests, where the data comes from.

---

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "__schema": {
      "queryType": {
        "name": "Query"
      },
      "mutationType": null,
      "subscriptionType": null,
      "types": [
        {
          "kind": "OBJECT",
          "name": "Query",
          "description": null,
          "fields": [
            ...
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

^ There's actually no need to understand the JSON representation of Relay schema. It looks barely readable for a human anyway. Since JSON can be generated from any other kind of source, we'll use Javascript code to define schema.

---

## Let's define one!

^ Let's define a brand new GraphQL schema. Say, you want a Netflix-like service that showcases top 5 movies per production costs (or simply said, most expensive movies everA) and tells a bit more about every one of them.

---

Movies

^ Time to think about movies, specifically about what data defines a movie.

---

- title,

^ Every movie has a title, or course.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"
}
```

^ In JSON form, a movie that has a title would look like an object with just one property: `title`.

---

- cover,

^ Those who are more visual than audial would distinguish movies by their covers. Let's say that, in our case, cover is just a reference to image, an image URL.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg"
}
```

---

- year,

^ Every movie has been released in a certain year. Let's store this data, too.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011"
}
```

^ A year may be represented by either number or a string that looks like a number. Let's use the latter.

---

- cost, and finally

^ Since the goal is to showcase the most expensive movies in history, we definitely need this property: cost of a movie.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011",
  "cost": 378.5
}
```

Let's trim zeros, be less specific, and save a few bytes. The convention is, this number is millions. "On Stranger Tides"'s production cost was 378.5 million dollars.

---

- starring actors

^ Are you as curious about the starring actors? I dare you are! Let's show this information, too.

---

```javascript
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011",
  "cost": 378.5,
  "starring": [] // ?
}
```

---

wait, but what kind of information?

^ If we want to associate starring actors with every movie, it's definitely going to be a collection of entities. We could store them simply as list of strings, but to make things a little more interesting and see how GraphQL would deal with it, let's make the value of `starring` an array of objects!

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011",
  "cost": 378.5,
  "starring": [{
    "name": "Johnny Depp"
  }, {
    "name": "PenÃ©lope Cruz"
  }, {
    "name": "Ian McShane"
  }, {
    "name": "Kevin R. McNally"
  }, {
    "name": "Geoffrey Rush"
  }]
}
```

^ That's it. Every starring actor is represented by an object with just a single property: name. That should be enough for us to discover the way GraphQL works with nested structures, especially when collections (arrays) and objects are mixed.

---

### Collection of movies!

^ Now, there are many movies, of course. So the actual data set is a collection of top most expensive movies ever. Let's actually limit this set by just 10 movies.

---

## Time to code!

^ Let's code a little bit. To define GraphQL schema, we'll use Javascript. It's a great example of shared code. The code will generate schema for both client and server.

---

```javascript
const {
  GraphQLSchema,
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLList,
  GraphQLString,
  GraphQLInt,
  GraphQLFloat
} = require('graphql')
const movies = require('./movies.json')
```

^ The easiest way to get started with GraphQL is to omit all the extra data sources and stick to the simplest data storage tool ever: a file! Top 10 most expensive movies every are nicely stored in form of JSON in a file "movies.json". Typical importa are `GraphQLSchema` and a bunch of other objects that define types for GraphQL schema.

---

### `GraphQLSchema`

^ This one is the core of your schema. You literally create `new GraphQLSchema(...)` to define it.

---

### `GraphQLObjectType`, `GraphQLList`

^ The two define, respectively, a field of object type (something that has unsorted named properties) and of list type (something that has sorted unnamed properties)

---

### `GraphQLString`, `GraphQLInt`, `GraphQLFloat`

^ The three are scalars and pretty much describe themselves: the first defines a field of string type, the second is for integer number, and the last one is for floating point number.

---

ðŸ¤”

Why not just Number or String?

^ If we define types, why not just pass native Javascript object prototypes like `Number`, `String`, `Boolean` or `Array` and let GraphQL do its job behind the scenes? Good question! Simply said, because GraphQL is platform-agnostic. It does not rely solely on Javascript type system. You can easily build a GraphQL server in Clojure, Go or Ruby, and in all these cases, the schema will be the same. So, we need a more solid and universal way to declare fields, so it's a little bit more verbose and requires extra code for every field definition.

---

The schema!

^ Let's see how the schema for a collection of movies would look like

---

```javascript
new GraphQLSchema({
  query: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Query',
    fields: {
      movies: {
        type: new GraphQLList(movie),
        resolve: () => movies
      },
      movie: {
        type: movie,
        args: {
          index: {
            type: GraphQLInt
          }
        },
        resolve: (r, {index}) => movies[index - 1]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

^ Alright, that was too much. Let's try smaller steps.

---

```javascript
new GraphQLSchema(â€¢)
```

^ To create a new GraphQL schema, we call `new GraphQLSchema`. The only argument that this contructor takes is GraphQLSchemaConfig, an object that at least has to have `query` property. The value of this property is GraphQLObjectTypeConfig (just add "...Config" everywhere to refer to certain type's config definition).

---

```javascript
new GraphQLObjectType(â€¢)
```

^ So, let's describe GraphQLObjectTypeConfig!

---

```javascript
new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  fields: {
    // ...
  }
})
```

^ For every type you declare, you have to assign name via `name` property. Calling `new GraphQLObjectType` with an object that is missing "name" property is not valid, and you'll have an exception. Optionally, you can also add "description" property and assign a detailed description of this GraphQL object type, but for such a simple schema, we simply don't need it. Let's move on and finish the object!

---

```javascript
new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  fields: {
    movies: {
      type: new GraphQLList(movie),
      resolve: () => movies
    },
    // ...
  }
})
```

^ We have a single field in this schema, "movies". There's actually a problem here with this code: while `movies` variable has already been declared in the beginning (remember `movies = require('./movies/json')`?), the singular form `movie` is undefined. You'll have an error. The trick is, well, to define it, but we'll come to it later.

---

```javascript
new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  fields: {
    movies: {
      type: new GraphQLList(movie),
      resolve: () => movies
    },
    movie: {
      type: movie,
      args: {
        index: {
          type: GraphQLInt
        }
      },
      resolve: (r, {index}) => movies[index - 1]
    }
  }
})
```

^ Again, `movie` is something that we haven't defined yet. It's definitely a type definition, because we assign the value of it to "type" property of `movie` field. Now, our query supports two types of fields: "movies" and "movie". Now, we can query either "movies" or "movie", taking value of the corresponding field.

---

```javascript
{
  resolve: () => movies
}
```

^ See how every field definition has `resolve` property? This is how the fields are _resolved_, which means what data the server will send in response when these fields are queried. The value of `resolve` property is a function of a bunch of argument. For "movies", we want to return the whole list of movies (again, remember that JSON?), so we don't really need any arguments: no matter what, we'll return the whole array.

---

```javascript
{
  resolve: (r, {index}) => movies[index - 1]
}
```

^ For a single movie, `resolve` look a bit different. Here, it takes two arguments. The first argument is _source_, which we actually don't need in this case. The second argument is _args_, an object where keys are arguments and values are, well, the values. Earlier, we described the only argument for "movie" field: `index`. So we can simply deconstruct this argument in place using curly brace syntax and pick `index` out of it. Since `movies` is an array, we can pick any element of this array by index. Which is exactly what we do, with only adjustment that, instead of 0-base indexing, we use 1-base, which means that the first element has index 1.

---

```javascript
new GraphQLSchema({
  query: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Query',
    fields: {
      movies: {
        type: new GraphQLList(movie),
        resolve: () => movies
      },
      movie: {
        type: movie,
        args: {
          index: {
            type: GraphQLInt
          }
        },
        resolve: (r, {index}) => movies[index - 1]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

^ Let's take a look at our schema definition again. Is it clearer now? Again, the schema is called "Query" (just a common convention among GraphQL developers), it has two fields: "movies" and "movie", the "movies" field resolves directly into the whole collection of movies (array of objects), while "movie" requires one argument, `index`, and resolves into just one element of the whole collection of movies that corresponds to `index`. Type of `index` is `GraphQLInt`, which should be clear: it's an integer. Now, let's see what's missing...

---

### `movie`

^ Alright, we still have `movie` variable undefined. It's a GraphQL type that defines a single movie. Do you remember how a movie has title, cost and starring actors? That's precisely it. Let's declare it.

---

```javascript
const movie = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Movie',
  fields: {
    title: {
      // ...
    },
    cover: {
      // ...
    },
    year: {
      // ...
    },
    cost: {
      // ...
    },
    starring: {
      // ...
    }
  }
})
```

^ Here it is, `movie`! It's a type! Since every movie is represented by a set of properties, the most suitable type is object type, hence `GraphQLObjectType`. It has all the familiar properties: title, cover, cost and such. Let's define every one of them!

---

```javascript
title: {
  type: GraphQLString
}
```

^ For `title`, it's easy: it's just a string, it's scalar type, and to define it, we assign this field with type set to `GraphQLString`. Take note that there's no `new`, because we don't create a new type of base type `GraphQLString`. The type itself is so basic that we don't need to extend it.

---

```javascript
cover: {
  type: GraphQLString
}
```

^ Same for cover.

---

```javascript
year: {
  type: GraphQLString
}
```

^ And for year. Remember how we made an assumption that year is represented by string that looks like a year and not by an integer number that looks like a year? Hence `GraphQLString`.

---

```javascript
cost: {
  type: GraphQLFloat
}
```

^ For cost, we use floating point number. Lucky us, in GraphQL, there's a perfectly suitable type for that: `GraphQLFloat`. Just like `GraphQLString`, it's scalar, basic and not extendable.

---

```javascript
starring: {
  type: new GraphQLList(new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'starring',
    fields: {
      name: {
        type: GraphQLString
      }
    }
  }))
}
```

^ Well, list of starring actorsâ€”because it is a listâ€”has a bit more complex definition of the field. But we intentionally made it a list of objects where objects are simple and only have one property, "name". Since it is a list of objects, you can spot `new GraphQLList(new GraphQLObjectType(â€¢))`. This is how we define list of objects in GraphQL schema. The only property every item in `starring` has is "name". Every actor has a name, after all.

---

ðŸ¤”

Why not simply array of strings?

^ You might be curious why we didn't pick just list of strings for "starring" field? Well, we definitely could. The only reason we picked a more complex schema type is _experiment_. We are experimenting, and you'll see how it reflects in the way you bind your components to data source.

---

### Almost there!

^ You may wonder, are we all set by now, as we have finished defining the schema? Well, yes and no. The schema is ready, the server can use it, but there's no server yet. We need to write some code to create a server that responds to GraphQL queries using our schema.

---

## Generate GraphQL Schema

^ To make our future Relay app work, we need to transform our Javascript code into JSON representation of GraphQL schema. To do this, let's write a very simple script:

---

`$ npm install --save-dev babel-relay-plugin`

^ Let's use an NPM package that is called "babel-relay-plugin". To put things short, it generates GraphQL schema and puts it into Javascript bundle in most efficient way. After that, you will have your schema bundled into the file that is accessible in the browser. Front-end part, especially Relay part, will have the schema as basis for queries. Just take a note that, because Relay is full-stack framework, schema _must_ be a part of your front-end app.

---

Schema has to be shared between front-end and back-end!

^ Now let's make sure that the schema is really bundled into the front-end app code.

---

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const jsonFile = path.join(__dirname, './schema.json')

fs.access(jsonFile, fs.F_OK, (err) => {
  if (!err) {
    module.exports = require('babel-relay-plugin')(require(jsonFile).data)
  }
})
```

^ This little piece of code will be executed every time Webpack runs your code through Babel. This snippet is a _Babel plugin_ that, as you can see, reads from file system and outputs the result the same way as any other Javascript module would do it: through `module.exports`. The actual result is that JSON representation of GraphQL schema is put into front-end app Javascript bundle. The browser receives this schema as part of your React app!

---

JSON?

^ But wait, there's no JSON file! We need to generate it from Javascript representation of our GraphQL schema. We need to take executable Javascript code and transform it into declarative JSON.

---

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')
const { graphql } = require('graphql')
const { introspectionQuery, printSchema } = require('graphql/utilities')
const schema = require('./schema')

const jsonFile = path.join(__dirname, './schema.json')

function generateSchema() {
  graphql(schema, introspectionQuery).then(response => {
    fs.writeFileSync(jsonFile, JSON.stringify(response))
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error(error.stack)
  })
}

module.exports = generateSchema
```

^ To generate JSON, we need to do three things: 1. Take JS code (`require` it). 2. Run JS through utility function that comes with "graphql" package, and 3. Save stringified JSON to file system. You can see that `graphql` function is called with two arguments: schema and `introspectionQuery`. Introspection is the feature of GraphQL that allows any app to dig into schema without really executing any query, but instead to get information about what query can be executed.

---

http://graphql.org/learn/introspection/

^ You can learn more about introspection in the official GraphQL docs. For now, let's just assume that `graphql` function needs this second argument to get meta-information from Javascript schema to transform it into JSON properly.

---
