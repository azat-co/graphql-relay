# GraphQL server

---

Start with schema

^ When you want to use GraphQL, think about your data schema. It doesn't need to be a solid and super stable database design, you can start with bare minimum. Think about schema as if you were creating tables in an SQL database: just before you start querying it, you need to define columns and such. With GraphQL, it's similar, but instead of columns, you have _queries_ and _fields_.

---

### What is GraphQL schema?

^ GraphQL schema has to be _shareable_ between client and server; usually it's a massive JSON. In this JSON, all possible queries are defined, so that your front-end knows if a certain query is valid, and if so, how to decontruct it; and your back-end knows how to _resolve_ fields of the query, which basically means that, for every entity that client requests, where the data comes from.

---

```json
{
  "data": {
    "__schema": {
      "queryType": {
        "name": "Query"
      },
      "mutationType": null,
      "subscriptionType": null,
      "types": [
        {
          "kind": "OBJECT",
          "name": "Query",
          "description": null,
          "fields": [
  ...
```

^ There's actually no need to understand the JSON representation of Relay schema. It looks barely readable for a human anyway. Since JSON can be generated from any other kind of source, we'll use Javascript code to define schema.

---

## Let's define one!

^ Let's define a brand new GraphQL schema. Say, you want a Netflix-like service that showcases top 5 movies per production costs (or simply said, most expensive movies everA) and tells a bit more about every one of them.

---

Movies

^ Time to think about movies, specifically about what data defines a movie.

---

- title,

^ Every movie has a title, or course.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"
}
```

^ In JSON form, a movie that has a title would look like an object with just one property: `title`.

---

- cover,

^ Those who are more visual than audial would distinguish movies by their covers. Let's say that, in our case, cover is just a reference to image, an image URL.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg"
}
```

---

- year,

^ Every movie has been released in a certain year. Let's store this data, too.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011"
}
```

^ A year may be represented by either number or a string that looks like a number. Let's use the latter.

---

- cost, and finally

^ Since the goal is to showcase the most expensive movies in history, we definitely need this property: cost of a movie.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011",
  "cost": 378.5
}
```

Let's trim zeros, be less specific, and save a few bytes. The convention is, this number is millions. "On Stranger Tides"'s production cost was 378.5 million dollars.

---

- starring actors

^ Are you as curious about the starring actors? I dare you are! Let's show this information, too.

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011",
  "cost": 378.5,
  "starring": ???
}
```

---

wait, but what kind of information?

^ If we want to associate starring actors with every movie, it's definitely going to be a collection of entities. We could store them simply as list of strings, but to make things a little more interesting and see how GraphQL would deal with it, let's make the value of `starring` an array of objects!

---

```json
{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "cover": "https://moviecovers.org/POTC_OST.jpg",
  "year": "2011",
  "cost": 378.5,
  "starring": [{
  "name": [{
    "name": "Johnny Depp"
  }, {
    "name": "Penélope Cruz"
  }, {
    "name": "Ian McShane"
  }, {
    "name": "Kevin R. McNally"
  }, {
    "name": "Geoffrey Rush"
  }]
}
```

^ That's it. Every starring actor is represented by an object with just a single property: name. That should be enough for us to discover the way GraphQL works with nested structures, especially when collections (arrays) and objects are mixed.
