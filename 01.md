# GraphQL and Relay

^ REST is still very popular, perhaps _most_ popular API architecture. With REST, you declare _resources_ and map HTTP methods to _operations_ against these resources. The problem is, if you want to fetch three users and then

---

### REST is classic

---

REST has been around since early 2000's, it is everywhere, and it has proven to be stable and maintainable.

> What's the problem?

---

## REST is too stable

---

Back in days, **API architect** was the boss, and the API design was confirmed, approved and fixed weeks before engineering team would start working on its implementation.

---

These days, **user** is the boss. Whenever the user feels the app is too slow, a single decision is enough for them to make you lose a fraction of your profit.

---

> Users want a faster and more responsive app

---

We need better network performance.

^ Back in days, the app was planned and prototyped, and it would take weeks before the first version appeared. Designing such an API that would stay stable for the next few versions was a pretty valuable skill. Nowadays, it's different, the product is delivered continuously, the "version" thing is getting blurry, and requirements may change in a blink of an eye. API design is still valuable as skill, but not any longer valuable as product.

---

How do we return a list of movies in REST API?

---

Request:

```
GET https://api.example.com/v1/movies.json
```

---

Response:

```javascript
[{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  // ...
}]
```

^ Let's say, we have a Netflix-like app, and on the main screen, there is the list of movies. A typical REST request contains API URL, API version, resource path and format. It's just perfect until we want to fetch actors for every movie.

---

### Now, let's fetch starring actors of every movie!

---

```
GET https://api/example.com/v1/movies/:movie_id/actors.json
```

---

A little problem:

we need to persist `movie_id` during all these API calls.

---

### A bigger problem:

### we need to wait until all the requests have been resolved.

---

## The real problem:

## too many HTTP requests!

^ It's a very typical problem in RESTful API architecture: when entities are nested, you need to fetch parent entity and then many child entities, and the number of entities multiplied by number of layers can be hure.

---

### Typical REST workflow: let's include!

^ That's the most common pattern, after simply putting child entities into REST API response.

---

You may prevent numerous API requests by sometimes including actors and sometimes not, by "includes" query parameter:

---

```
GET https://api.example.com/v1/movies.json?includes=starring
```

^ Request

---

```javascript
[{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "starring": [{
    // ...
  }]
  // ...
}]
```

^ Response.

---

What is we want to be flexible in what properties of what entities to fetch? Includes of includes?

---

### Too many hacks

---

# GraphQL to the rescue!

---

### Example of GraphQL query

---

```
GET https://api.example.com/
"{
  movies {
    title
    starring {
      name
    }
  }
}"
```

^ Here, we say "we need movies, for every movie we need title and list of starring actors, and for every actor, we need their name"...

---

```javascript
[{
  "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
  "starring": [{
    "name": "Johnny Depp"
  }, {
    // ...
  }]
  // ...
}, {
  // ...
}]
```

^ ...and we receive precisely that!

---

In GraphQL, we have

---

- single API endpoint,

---

- language that directly describes data we want to fetch, and

---

- response that precisely reflects the query in its data schema.

^ It's all different. No more resources, no more formats, but a sophisticated query language and single-endpoint architecture.

---

### So, why GraphQL?

---

- future-proof the API,

---

- bring data schema and query language closer together, and

^ in GraphQL, query represents data schema, so the code is documenting itself.

---

- reduce the number of request _and_ API complexity.

^ With REST, you need to invent and improvise, and later on, to keep the documentation separately. There are tools like Swagger, that simplify this process and allow keeping two things together, but still, it doesn't remove the necessity of making multiple requests to fetch multiple data entities.

---

Still think REST is the best?

Well, at least there is a choice.

---

### So, who invented GraphQL?

---

# Facebook's engineering team

^ It was Facebook. These guys know pretty much about changing requirements, rapidly evolving product, constant fluctuation of data model, and high expectations of users. It's a technology company, and technology they use must be flawless. No wonder they created something completely new, and this new fortunately turned out to be universal and useful.

---

### Facebook's engineering team that was frustrated

---

_We don't think of data in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; ..._

---

_... we think about it in terms of a graph of objects and the models we ultimately use in our apps like NSObjects or JSON._

^ It's on their dev blog: https://code.facebook.com/posts/1691455094417024/graphql-a-data-query-language/

---

Is it just a "next hot tech" that will burn out in a few months?

^ Well, it didn't, because ...

---

GraphQL is 4 years old.

(REST is 16)

^ The common mistake is to think about every new library as "new hot thing" that will sparkle a little and then dim into darkness. GraphQL has been around for 4 years, which is a good mark for tech that competes with long-playing standard, which REST has been for 16 years.

---

### Who is using GraphQL?

^ [Who is using GraphQL in production?](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-using-GraphQL-in-production-besides-Facebook-itself) (an actual question on Quora)

---

GitHub

---

Coursera

---

Pinterest, Intuit, Shopify, ...

^ GraphQL **is** production-ready, and companies **do** love the flexibility and performance it gives.

---

### Why should I use it?

---

- retrieve data faster and reduce the bandwidth usage,

---

- test a single source of data instead of multiple resources, or

---

- reduce the abstraction of queries against data layer of your app.

^ In GraphQL, a single request delivers all the data you need, whatever the amount is. You can test a single API endpoint with various queries instead of juggling different resources. And finally, the way query is described might be close enough to the data schema of your storage: think how MongoDB and JSON are similar, and add GraphQL that operates on the same data structures.

---

But wait, there's more!

---

# Relay

---

Full-stack,

^ Relay is a full-stack framework, which means you declare your data schema one time and then use it on both back-end and front-end.

---

Declarative,

^ Instead of imperatively saying "fetch list of movies from that RESTful resource" (think `jQuery.get`, `axios.get` or simply `window.fetch`), you say "this component depends on list of movies, and out of all properties of every movie, it needs just title".

---

Composable.

^ With Relay, you compose different GraphQL queries into a single, bigger query. If you have hierarchy of components where parent relies on list of movies and children represent details of every movie, Relay will compose the two into just a single GraphQL query behind the scenes, so your app will perform _just one query_ in best case, no matter how many different properties or entities it needs!

---

```javascript
Relay.createContainer(Movies, {
  fragments: {
    movies: () => Relay.QL`
      fragment on Movies {
        title
      }
    `
  }
})
```

^ Here's how it would look like. Let's deconstruct this example and walk through it step by step.

---

```javascript
Relay.createContainer
```

^ `Relay.createContainer` takes two arguments: the component and the _container specification_. The first is simply a React object that will receive props, and second is query that maps data to props. It's like Redux, but instead of Redux Store, we have GraphQL data store.

---

```javascript
Movies
```

^ `Movies` is a React component. It may even be a stateless function!

---

```javascript
{
  fragments: {
    movies: () => Relay.QL`
      fragment on Movies {
        title
      }
    `
  }
}
```

---

```javascript
function Movies(props) {
  const { movies } = props

  return (
    <div>
      {movies.map((movie, index) => (
        <div>{movie.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```
