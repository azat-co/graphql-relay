# GraphQL and Relay

^ REST is still very popular, perhaps _most_ popular API architecture. With REST, you declare _resources_ and map HTTP methods to _operations_ against these resources. The problem is, if you want to fetch three users and then

# Why GraphQL?

We have REST. Why do we need another API architecture?

- The longer a product is in development, the greater chance data model will change.
- REST is good when data model is fixed and never changes.
- REST isn't as good when you need to rewrite the API.

^ REST is established API development standard that's been around for ages. There's a little problem with REST that FB guys didn't like: in RESTful architecture, you have to query every resource separately. There are _at least_ as many different HTTP requests as resources. If resource B depends on resource A, you need to maintain this dependency A-to-B between requests. Typically, if A has `id` property, B has `a_id` property to keep the relation. But once you need any other kind of relationship, you have to rewrite a good amount of API, and nobody really likes rewriting old stuff.

### REST is too stable

REST comes from times when API architect was the boss, and the plan was fixed weeks before engineering team would start working on its implementation.

These days, **user** is the boss. Whenever the user feels the app is too slow, a single decision is enough for them to make you lose a fraction of your profit.

User wants a faster app, therefore we need better network performance.

^ Back in days, the app was planned and prototyped, and it would take weeks before the first version appeared. Designing such an API that would stay stable for the next few versions was a pretty valuable skill. Nowadays, it's different, the product is delivered continuously, the "version" thing is getting blurry, and requirements may change in a blink of an eye. API design is still valuable as skill, but not any longer valuable as product.

### Who invented GraphQL?

# Facebook

^ It was Facebook. These guys know pretty much about changing requirements, rapidly evolving product, constant fluctuation of data model, and high expectations of users. It's a technology company, and technology they use must be flawless. No wonder they created something completely new, and this new fortunately turned out to be universal and useful.

### Who is using GraphQL?

[Who is using GraphQL in production?](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-using-GraphQL-in-production-besides-Facebook-itself) (an actual question on Quora)

> — GitHub, Pinterest, Intuit, Coursera, Shopify and many more.

^ It's a real question and real answer on Quora, see https://www.quora.com/Who-is-using-GraphQL-in-production-besides-Facebook-itself. GraphQL **is** production-ready, and companies **do** love the flexibility and performance it gives.

### Let's try it out!

Let's see how GraphQL can be used to build a simple Netflix clone.

^ Once having an idea of building a Netflix clone, you may instantly have RESTful data schema popped out on your mind. Hold on! Let's use GraphQL to perform queries and update data on the back-end.
